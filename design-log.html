  <h5>Wednesday</h5>
  When gaining information for Git Hub and Atom I started to push changes to my website using these programmes which included changing photography and font changes. By experimenting with different fonts and images I could then picture what I wanted my website to look like.
  We looked at introduction to web associability and manufacturing of still images

  We explored different design methods which would give us ides for our own website.


  <br> With the information and theory provided to me I am now using this to start editing my website and CSS such as fonts and colours.

  <h5>Thursday</h5>
In the photography class Lawrence had brought in a guest speaker to discuss the importance of social media and marketing. Ryan from Salford city FC went through a few different skills he uses such as the rule of thirds, the different angles he uses to film a post-match interview. He also went through some basic skills on how to edit a video on premier pro.

<rb> By listening to Ryan, I had learned some new interview skills and camera angles, which I have now put into practice. I can now shoot the rule of thirds during an interview, and make sure you have the talking space in the background to be correct.

              In this class we had to create a new repository on Atom called mp-portfolio which we then had to copy all of the data from our previous repository onto the new one. After committing this to Github we then move on about the importance of the colour theory for our website. Christine explained the different terms we can use such as colour palette and complementary colours which are colours on the opposite of the colour wheel.  This means we are then pairing colours together to make a colour scheme for my website. We also looked at the psychology of colour and talked about how different colours have different meanings. In the photography class we looked at editing and production. We looked at file management and the importance of creating a checklist before shooting audio, photography and video making sure all of the settings are correct

              <rb> When looking at the basics in the photography class it was very helpful for the video and audio content as I wild then know how to set up an audio and video interview. He also touched on making sure your audio levels are correct before conduction an interview, as it they are to quite it is then hard to edit the interview.

   <p>In this class we learned what Alt text and how we can use it for our website. We learned why it is important to have alt text, it makes your whole website more accessible for your whole audience. Once we learned why it was important to use it, we then learned how to implement it to our website.</p>

<br> <p>In this lesson we learned about the importance of making your website accessible to all users. When looking at all aspects that were discussed in class making your website more accessible will be beneficial to everyone.</p>

During this class I was shown how to resize images on photoshop. For the image to be compatible for web use I had to resize the image to be the right size for my site. After this I had to export the image to web legacy, once that had been completed, I had to change the image on Atom and make it live on my website.

<rb>This is beneficial for my website as by knowing the proper way to resize an image it will ensure that my images will not be disproportionate.

This was very helpful for me as I could then resize all my images independently and ensure they were the right size for my website.

Today we looked at making an infographic for one of my Final Images. We used a tool called Canva which is great as it has great layouts and templates to create an infographic.

<rb> The infographic session is helpful especially since I am planning to include a few infographics into my design log pages to make it more visually appealing. By using the website Canva, it actually helps me create interesting and informative infographics for my website.

This practice will be very useful for my actual videography work as I will know the basics when it comes to video production and I will be able to implement it onto my actual work

We created a structure on how we would be scripting the interview, two of us made sure we collected correct information about the interviewee and the other person collated the information and structed our questions. We started with a short introduction explaining who we are interviewing and what the subject would be on. We had a clear script with a introduction, three question and an outro.

<rb> By scripting the §interview, it helped us as a group as we then had background information on our interviewee and gave us a structure on how the interview will flow.

  Today I was making sure all my content was embedded onto my website. I used Vimeo to embed my video interview onto my website. I was able to edit the hex code on the clip to match my colour scheme which fitted in nicely. With my audio interview I used SoundCloud and also did the same by editing the colour of the clip to match my website design. I then used atom to embed the HTML link to my live site.

  <rb> Embedding it was also quite simple, it was similar to when I embedded the audio. This helped me organise for the final day of the assignment as I could then make a structured plan on what I needed to finish. By using the skills, I have previously learnt. I can then embed the HTML link into Atom and make sure both clips are working properly.

  <h5>Friday</h5>

  On the last day of the assignment I spent most of the day making sure my website had the correct layout, colours, images and audio. I used photoshop to make some final images and make sure they were formatted correctly for the web. I looked at making the final tweaks to my design log, making sure I had included all of the techniques I had learned were explained properly.

  <rb> On the final day I went through my website and made changes to some images and resized them on Photoshop. I also made sure all my images had alt text to help with the accessibility of my website. I also added links on my homepage to direct you to my audio, photography and my video page this also helped with the navigation of my website.
